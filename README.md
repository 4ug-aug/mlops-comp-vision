Project in MLOPS
==============================


1. **Overall project goal:** This project is about setting up a proper MLObs pipeline to train, test, deploy and monitor deep learning models that performs image classification.
2. **Framework:** As we are going to perform image classification the Pytorch image models (timm) framwork is well suited for our task. The timm framwork provides a lot of utilities in regards to image classification such a pretrained models and training pipelines.
3. **Intended use of framework:** In many domains of image classification the tasks share some high level common features, this allows for the utilization of models trained on other image domains. The timm framwork provides a lot of pretrained models, and our intend is to try and improve on some of these.
4. **Data:** The scope of this project is to perform image classification on the CIFAR10 dataset. This dataset consist of 32x32 colored images with 10 different classes. There are a total of 50000 training images and 10000 test images and the classes are equally distributed. We only plan to work with a subset of the data since it makes everything easier to work with, since the overall scope is not the performance of the model.
5. **Deep learning models:** We plan to use deep convolutional neural networks as they are most commonly used for image classification.
